Hello world!
I am teaching myself how to code (again?). This is defintly a throwback to the myspace days where I would spend hours and hours formating, editing, and perfecting my profile. Not to impress anyone, I actually don't know if anyone cared. It was challenging, changing, and fluid. Much like my life. It soothed me knowing something else in the universe needed fluidity the same way.
